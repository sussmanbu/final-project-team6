We found that the NYPD_Arrest_data dataset can be combined with out NYPD_Shooting_incident dataset as we will try to see if there is a relationship between shooting incidents and arrests based on locations. We are also thinking of checking median income by location and seeing how our data correlates with the income. We are combining the datasets based on Latitude and Longitude.
