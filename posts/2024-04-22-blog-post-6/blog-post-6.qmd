Added a new dataset with Payroll information and we used this data to explore how in different boroughs of New York City, we found relationships between arrests, race, and pay range. We also used a logistic regression model to predict if there was a murder or not. 

While exploring the data we found that the areas with lower income, had the highest White Hispanic and Black populations.
