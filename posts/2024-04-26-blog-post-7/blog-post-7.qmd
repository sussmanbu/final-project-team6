## Tentative Thesis
Our objective is to unveil the intersection of poverty, race, and policing in NYC.

In New York City, there exists a significant correlation between low-income areas, predominantly black populations, and elevated rates of both arrests and police-involved shootings. Through an exploration of key datasets encompassing NYPD shooting incidents, payroll information, and arrest records, this analysis sheds light on the complex dynamics at play within the cityâ€™s socio-economic and racial landscape.

## Polish Our Visualization
We added titles, annotations, and highlights to the plots.
