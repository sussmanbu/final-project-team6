This comes from the file `data.qmd`.

Your first steps in this project will be to find data to work on.

I recommend trying to find data that interests you and that you are knowledgeable about. A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.


Initially, you will study _one dataset_ but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable.
Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components.


## What makes a good data set?

* Data you are interested in and care about.
* Data where there are a lot of potential questions that you can explore.
* A data set that isn't completely cleaned already.
* Multiple sources for data that you can combine.
* Some type of time and/or location component.


## Where to keep data?


Below 50mb: In `dataset` folder

Above 50mb: In `dataset_ignore` folder. This folder will be ignored by `git` so you'll have to manually sync these files across your team.

### Sharing your data


For small datasets (<50mb), you can use the `dataset` folder that is tracked by github. Add the files just like you would any other file.

If you create a folder named `data` this will cause problems.

For larger datasets, you'll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named `dataset-ignore`. This will be ignored by git (based off the `.gitignore` file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github's size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in `dataset-ignore` are synced across team members.

Your [load_and_clean_data.R](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R) file is how you will load and clean your data. Here is a an example of a very simple one.

You should never use absolute paths (eg. `/Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/` or `C:\MA415\\Final_Project\`).

You might consider using the `here` function from the [`here` package](https://here.r-lib.org/articles/here.html) to avoid path problems.


### Load and clean data script

The idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them.
This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis.
Note that you don't need to run this script from every post/page.
Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which could be plain text files or `.RData` files. In your data page you'll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes.
To link to this file, you can use `[cleaning script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R)` wich appears as [cleaning script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R).

## Rubric: On this page

You will

* Describe where/how to find data.
  * You must include a link to the original data source(s). Make sure to provide attribution to those who collected the data.
  * Why was the data collected/curated? Who put it together? (This is important, if you don't know why it was collected then that might not be a good dataset to look at.
* Describe the different data files used and what each variable means. 
  * If you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones and summarize the rest.
* Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data.
  * You *must* include a link to your `load_and_clean_data.R` file.
  * Rrename variables and recode factors to make data more clear.
  * Also, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.
  * Describe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.
  * Some repetition of what you do in your `load_and_clean_data.R` file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.
* Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other organization tools, etc.
  * This page should be self-contained.
  
## NYPD Shooting Data - Team 6
  
### Data Background

This dataset encompasses a detailed account of each shooting incident in NYC from 2006 up until the end of the last calendar year. Compiled and meticulously reviewed quarterly by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning, it is then made accessible on the NYPD website. Every entry in this dataset chronicles a specific shooting event, detailing the incident's circumstances, location, and timing. Additionally, it provides demographics regarding suspects and victims.

The data might be biased as it is based only on New York. It might not be able to reflect the circumstances of shootings and the characteristics of shooters in a broader setting. Besides, the age is categorized by ranges, such as 18-24, 25-44, and 45-64, which might not be clear and specific enough. Without a more detailed record of the shooting incidents, we do not know the number of perpetrators and victims. The lack of a detailed understanding of the level of severity of the incidents may cause bias in our analysis. 

The data has been used on another capstone project, “Phantom Shootings,” by Allan Ambris, The Graduate Center, City University of New York. This data is used to prove the author’s statement that the data NYPD reported is just a subset of the true dataset. The author asks whether a single victim may appear in many entries. (Ambris)

We are able to download the dataset from the original source. Link to the data:

### Summary of the Dataset structure and some key statistics

- **Total Entries**: 1,706 incidents.

- **Date Range**: The dataset includes an OCCUR_DATE column, suggesting the dates on which incidents occurred.

- **Location Data**: There are multiple columns related to the location of the incidents, such as BORO, PRECINCT, X_COORD_CD, Y_COORD_CD, Latitude, and Longitude.

- **Incident Details**: Includes details like JURISDICTION_CODE, LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC (Location Classification Description), and LOCATION_DESC.

- **Perpetrator and Victim Information**: Information on the perpetrator (PERP_AGE_GROUP, PERP_SEX, PERP_RACE) and victim (VIC_AGE_GROUP, VIC_SEX, VIC_RACE) is available.

- **Statistical Flags**: Includes a flag for statistical murders (STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG)

### Data Cleaning

```{r}
source(
  "scripts/load_and_clean_data.R",
  echo = TRUE # Use echo=FALSE or omit it to avoid code output  
)
```

We changed  'OCCUR_DATE' to DateTime format. We removed the OCCUR_TIME and LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC as we did not find them useful for our analysis. We also removed columns where we did not have the perpetrator's race or the victim's race.

#### Extra packages
- **corrplot**: used for visualizing correlation matrices and seeing the relationships between variables

- **GGally**: used in addition to ggplot again to visualize relationships between variables.
lubricate: used for datetime manipulation 


### Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Read the dataset
data <- readRDS("dataset/nypd_shooting_clean.rds")

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(data)

prep_race_counts <- data |>
  count(PERP_RACE) |>
  arrange(desc(n))

ggplot(prep_race_counts, aes(x = reorder(PERP_RACE, n), y = n, fill = PERP_RACE)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Perpetrator Race Distribution", x = "Perpetrator Race", y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
We created a bar chart to analyze the perpetrator's race, a key variable of interest for later investigation in our project. The chart revealed approximately 600 missing (null) values for this variable, indicating a potential challenge that requires our attention.
