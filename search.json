    "text": "This dataset encompasses a detailed account of each shooting incident in NYC from 2006 up until the end of the last calendar year. Compiled and meticulously reviewed quarterly by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning, it is then made accessible on the NYPD website. Every entry in this dataset chronicles a specific shooting event, detailing the incident’s circumstances, location, and timing. Additionally, it provides demographics regarding suspects and victims.\nThe data set primarily focuses on shooting incidents within New York, so it inherently limits the possibility of generalizing our findings to other locations. The age is categorized by ranges, such as 18-24, 25-44, and 45-64, which may reduce the precision of our analysis. Without a more detailed record of the shooting incidents, we do not know the number of perpetrators and victims. The lack of a detailed understanding of the level of severity of the incidents may cause bias in our analysis.\nThe data has been used on another capstone project, “Phantom Shootings,” by Allan Ambris, The Graduate Center, City University of New York. This data is used to prove the author’s statement that the data NYPD reported is just a subset of the true dataset. The author asks whether a single victim may appear in many entries. (Ambris)\nWe are able to download the dataset from the original source. Link to the data: NYPD Police Shootings\n\n\n\n\nTotal Entries: 1,706 incidents.\nDate Range: The dataset includes an OCCUR_DATE column, suggesting the dates on which incidents occurred.\nLocation Data: There are multiple columns related to the location of the incidents, such as BORO, PRECINCT, X_COORD_CD, Y_COORD_CD, Latitude, and Longitude.\nIncident Details: Includes details like JURISDICTION_CODE, LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC (Location Classification Description), and LOCATION_DESC.\nPerpetrator and Victim Information: Information on the perpetrator (PERP_AGE_GROUP, PERP_SEX, PERP_RACE) and victim (VIC_AGE_GROUP, VIC_SEX, VIC_RACE) is available. We will concentrate our analysis on examining potential differences among racial groups in shooting incidents, focusing specifically on the interplay between the perpetrator’s race (PERP_RACE) and the victim’s race (VIC_RACE), in conjunction with their gender and age.\nStatistical Flags: Includes a flag for statistical murders (STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG)\n\n\n\n\n\nsource(\n  \"scripts/load_and_clean_data.R\",\n  echo = FALSE # Use echo=FALSE or omit it to avoid code output\n  )\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\nRows: 27312 Columns: 21\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (12): OCCUR_DATE, BORO, LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC, LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC, LOCATION...\ndbl   (7): INCIDENT_KEY, PRECINCT, JURISDICTION_CODE, X_COORD_CD, Y_COORD_CD...\nlgl   (1): STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG\ntime  (1): OCCUR_TIME\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nspc_tbl_ [27,312 × 21] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ INCIDENT_KEY           : num [1:27312] 2.29e+08 1.37e+08 1.48e+08 1.47e+08 5.89e+07 ...\n $ OCCUR_DATE             : chr [1:27312] \"05/27/2021\" \"06/27/2014\" \"11/21/2015\" \"10/09/2015\" ...\n $ OCCUR_TIME             : 'hms' num [1:27312] 21:30:00 17:40:00 03:56:00 18:30:00 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"units\")= chr \"secs\"\n $ BORO                   : chr [1:27312] \"QUEENS\" \"BRONX\" \"QUEENS\" \"BRONX\" ...\n $ LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC      : chr [1:27312] NA NA NA NA ...\n $ PRECINCT               : num [1:27312] 105 40 108 44 47 81 114 81 105 101 ...\n $ JURISDICTION_CODE      : num [1:27312] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC     : chr [1:27312] NA NA NA NA ...\n $ LOCATION_DESC          : chr [1:27312] NA NA NA NA ...\n $ STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG: logi [1:27312] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE ...\n $ PERP_AGE_GROUP         : chr [1:27312] NA NA NA NA ...\n $ PERP_SEX               : chr [1:27312] NA NA NA NA ...\n $ PERP_RACE              : chr [1:27312] NA NA NA NA ...\n $ VIC_AGE_GROUP          : chr [1:27312] \"18-24\" \"18-24\" \"25-44\" \"&lt;18\" ...\n $ VIC_SEX                : chr [1:27312] \"M\" \"M\" \"M\" \"M\" ...\n $ VIC_RACE               : chr [1:27312] \"BLACK\" \"BLACK\" \"WHITE\" \"WHITE HISPANIC\" ...\n $ X_COORD_CD             : num [1:27312] 1058925 1005028 1007668 1006537 1024922 ...\n $ Y_COORD_CD             : num [1:27312] 180924 234516 209837 244511 262189 ...\n $ Latitude               : num [1:27312] 40.7 40.8 40.7 40.8 40.9 ...\n $ Longitude              : num [1:27312] -73.7 -73.9 -73.9 -73.9 -73.9 ...\n $ Lon_Lat                : chr [1:27312] \"POINT (-73.73083868899994 40.662964620000025)\" \"POINT (-73.92494232599995 40.81035186300006)\" \"POINT (-73.91549174199997 40.74260663300004)\" \"POINT (-73.91945661499994 40.83778200300003)\" ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..

It encompasses data curated from public sources, detailing the distribution of prison populations by race,\nThis data can help us understand how COVID-19 impacted prison populations, especially regarding racial disparities. We can see if these effects differ by location and explore reasons behind any such differences.Challenges might include missing information about how the data was collected and potential inconsistencies from different sources.\n\nNutrition and Physical Activity\n\nThis dataset records the status of weight and physical activity of US adults from 2011 to 2022 on both the national level and state levels. It comes with demographic information including age, race, gender, and income. It is posted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the data source is the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. It contains 93249 rows and 33 columns. The weight status and physical activity status are in percentages.\nWe intend to use this data to study in which groups obesity is more prevalent. With the demographic information, this data helps us understand factors affecting the rate of obesity from different angles. Besides, with proper analysis, the data can possibly explain what people can do to prevent obesity.\n\nNYPD Police Shootings\n\nThis data records a list of every shooting that has occurred in New York City since 2006, including detailed information about each shooting. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website, containing 21 columns and 27312 rows.\nEach record represents a shooting incident in New York City and includes information about the incident, where and when it occurred. Additionally, information related to suspect and victim demographics is included. This data can be used to explore the nature of shooting/criminal activity.\nBecause this data includes the race, gender, and age group of shooting suspects and victims, we can use this data to explore the frequency of shootings by race and the distribution of suspects and victims across racial categories."

    "text": "Data Background\nThis dataset encompasses a detailed account of each shooting incident in NYC from 2006 up until the end of the last calendar year. Compiled and meticulously reviewed quarterly by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning, it is then made accessible on the NYPD website. Every entry in this dataset chronicles a specific shooting event, detailing the incident’s circumstances, location, and timing. Additionally, it provides demographics regarding suspects and victims. We are able to download the dataset from the original source.\nThe data might be biased as it is based only on New York. It might not be able to reflect the circumstances of shootings and the characteristics of shooters in a broader setting. Besides, the age is categorized by ranges, such as 18-24, 25-44, and 45-64, which might not be clear and specific enough. Without a more detailed record of the shooting incidents, we do not know the number of perpetrators and victims. The lack of a detailed understanding of the level of severity of the incidents may cause bias in our analysis.\nThe data has been used on another capstone project, “Phantom Shootings,” by Allan Ambris, The Graduate Center, City University of New York. This data is used to prove the author’s statement that the data NYPD reported is just a subset of the true dataset. The author asks whether a single victim may appear in many entries. (Ambris) Ambris, Allan. “Phantom Shootings.” CUNY Academic Works, academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/5410/. Accessed 25 Mar. 2024.\n\n\nData for Equity\nThe Belmont Report’s principles of beneficence, respect for persons, and justice offer a robust ethical framework for handling data in ways that can significantly impact individuals and communities. Integrating these principles into the management and analysis of NYPD Shooting Incident Data can advance more equitable data practices, ensuring that this information is used responsibly and ethically.\nThe principle of respect for persons entails treating individuals as autonomous agents and protecting those with diminished autonomy. In the context of NYPD Shooting Incident Data, respect for persons means ensuring that the data does not unjustly stigmatize individuals or communities. Adhering to this principle, the dataset anonymized data, carefully handling data to remove or obfuscate any personally identifiable information to protect individuals’ privacy and dignity.\nThe principle of beneficence also applied to the NYPD Shooting Incident Data. Beneficence requires that the data practices minimize harm and maximize benefits. In the context of NYPD Shooting Incident Data, this principle underscores the importance of using the data to improve community safety, inform policy changes, and enhance police practices to prevent unnecessary violence."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don’t go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.\nEach figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\nCreativity\n\nDo your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.\n\nThis page should be self-contained.\n\nNote: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use #| echo: FALSE."

The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor’s approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.\n\nQuality and ease of use of the interactive components. Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components? Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture? Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!\n\n\n\nVideo Recording\nMake a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components. You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA. This video should be no longer than 4 minutes. Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website. This can be presented by any subset of the team members.\n\n\nRest of the Site\nFinally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.\nThe main title of your page is informative. Each post has an author/description/informative title. All lab required posts are present. Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it. Your about page is up to date and clean. You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template."
