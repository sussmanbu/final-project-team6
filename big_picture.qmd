# Behind the Numbers: Unveiling the Intersection of Poverty, Race, and Policing in NYC

In New York City, there exists a significant correlation between low-income areas, predominantly black populations, and elevated rates of both arrests and police-involved shootings. Through an exploration of key datasets encompassing NYPD shooting incidents, payroll information, and arrest records, this analysis sheds light on the complex dynamics at play within the city's socio-economic and racial landscape.

## Policing Poverty: The Hidden Truths of NYC's Streets

In the bustling streets of New York City, amongst the skyscrapers and vibrant neighborhoods, lies a city divided. In some communities, the sound of police sirens is an ever-present echo, a stark reminder of the realities faced by those living in inequality. But why do certain neighborhoods experience higher rates of arrests and police-involved shootings than others?


## Patterns of Pain

Mapping offense data points across NYC, we witness the clustering of crime in certain neighborhoods, painting a vivid picture of communities besieged by violence. Overlaying this map with the racial demographics of perpetrators and victims further illuminates the disproportionate impact on black individuals, particularly young men.

```{r nyc_tract map, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
shapefile_path <- "tl_2022_36_tract/tl_2022_36_tract.shp"
complete_data <- st_read(shapefile_path)
nyc_tracts <- complete_data |> 
  filter(COUNTYFP %in% c("005", "047", "061", "081", "085"))
```

```{r offense map, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
map_df <- st_as_sf(combined_df, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326, agr = "constant")
# Plotting the shapefile for NYC tracts and overlaying points
final_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nyc_tracts, fill = "white", color = "gray") +
  geom_sf(data = map_df, color = "brown3", size = 1, alpha = 0.5) +  # Adds the points
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Map of New York City with Offense Data Points", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude")

# Print the final plot
print(final_plot)
```

## Crimes of Desperation

Examining the most common crime descriptions, a troubling pattern emerges. Sex crimes, assault, and drug-related offenses dominate the landscape, pointing to the pervasive influence of poverty, addiction, and desperation within marginalized communities.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
combined_df |>
  group_by(OFNS_DESC) |>
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop') |>
  filter(Count >= 50) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(OFNS_DESC, Count), y = Count, fill = OFNS_DESC)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Offense Description", y = "Count") +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```


## Dollars and Desperation

Overlaying maps of average salaries by borough with crime data points, we confront the harsh reality of economic disparities. In neighborhoods where salaries are lowest, crime rates soarâ€”a testament to the profound impact of poverty on the social fabric of our city.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
average_salary_by_borough <- nypd_payroll %>%
  group_by(work_boro) %>%
  summarise(AverageSalary = mean(base_salary, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

borough_to_fips <- data.frame(
  work_boro = c("BRONX", "BROOKLYN", "MANHATTAN", "QUEENS", "OTHER"),  # Note: Ensure the names match the data
  COUNTYFP = c("005", "047", "061", "081", "085"))

average_salary_by_fips <- average_salary_by_borough %>%
  left_join(borough_to_fips, by = "work_boro")
average_salary_by_fips <- average_salary_by_fips %>%
  select(COUNTYFP, AverageSalary)

nyc_tracts_salary <- nyc_tracts %>%
  left_join(average_salary_by_fips, by = "COUNTYFP")

map_df <- st_transform(map_df, st_crs(nyc_tracts_salary)$epsg)
final_combined_plot2 <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nyc_tracts_salary, aes(fill = AverageSalary), color = "gray", size = 0.5) +
  geom_sf(data = map_df, aes(color = PERP_RACE), size = 1, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "deepskyblue4", name = "Avg Salary",
                      na.value = "grey50", labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER" = "green", "BLACK" = "brown3", "WHITE HISPANIC" = "yellow", "WHITE" = "deeppink", "UNKNOWN" = "darkgray", "BLACK HISPANIC" = "darkblue"), name = "Perpetrator's Race") +
  labs(title = "Average Salary and Crime Data Points by NYC Borough",
       subtitle = "Boroughs colored by average salary; Points indicate crime locations",
       fill = "Average Salary", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", color = "Perpetrator's Race") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
print(final_combined_plot2)
```
